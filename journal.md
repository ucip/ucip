    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">Acta Cogitata is dedicated to providing a venue for undergraduate authors of original philosophical papers to have their work reviewed and, possibly, published. Publication acknowledges the work of outstanding undergraduate authors, rewards their efforts, and provides a home for some thought-provoking projects. Acta Cogitata's authors retain the copyright so that they may continue to develop their projects. The journal does not publish work that has previously been published elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The journal accepts papers from all areas of philosophy and seeks to promote philosophical discourse in any area where such discourse may be illuminating.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The journal is published annually, in October.</p>
