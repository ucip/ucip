    <p class="text-justify">The UCiP will be held in McKenny Hall on the Eastern Michigan University campus. The address for McKenny Hall is:</p>
    <address>
      McKenny Hall<br>
      W. Cross St.<br>
      Ypsilanti, MI 48197
    </address>
    <p class="text-justify">Signs will be posted inside the building to help you navigate to the Conference rooms.</p>
    <h3>Disability Accessible Entrance</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">McKenny Hall's West and East entrances are disability accessible with ramps and handicap accessible doors. The west entrance faces the McKenny Staff and Commuter Pay* parking lots, while the east entrance faces the Pease Auditorium Pay* parking lot. These entrances are highlighted on the <a href="#embeddedMap">map embedded lower on this page</a>.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The UCiP is held on the 3rd floor of McKenny Hall. Signs are posted throughout the building to lead participants to the elevators and stairwells. McKenny Hall is a historical building, so its floor plan is a bit complicated. If you can't find the elevator, please email the UCiP team at <a href="mailto:emuucip@gmail.com">emuucip@gmail.com</a>. We will be monitoring the email for issues of this sort and we will provide an usher to help!</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><small>* Parking validation is offered to UCiP presenters and commenters.</small></p>
