    <h3 class="text-center">Mission</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">Acta Cogitata is dedicated to providing a venue for undergraduate authors of original philosophical papers to have their work reviewed and, possibly, published. Publication acknowledges the work of outstanding undergraduate authors, rewards their efforts, and provides a home for some thought-provoking projects. In line with this purpose, Acta Cogitata's authors retain their copyright so that they may continue to develop these projects. The journal, however, does not publish work that has previously been published elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The journal accepts philosophical papers from all areas of philosophy and seeks to promote philosophical discourse in any area where such discourse may be illuminating.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The journal is published annually, in October.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>Journal Editor:</b> Dr. W. John Koolage, <a href="mailto:wkoolage@emich.edu">wkoolage@emich.edu</a></p>
